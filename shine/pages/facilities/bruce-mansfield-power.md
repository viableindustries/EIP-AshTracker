Little Blue Run is the nation’s largest coal ash impoundment. At nearly 1,700 acres it straddles land in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. It is also completely unlined. In July of 2012, the Pennsylvania DEP filed a complaint and consent decree, finding that the impoundment’s seeps and associated discharges to groundwater “may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment,” in violation of federal law.

This action came 59 days after EIP, along with co-counsel at Public Justice, announced its intention to sue FirstEnergy, on behalf of community members with contaminated drinking water wells and property damage from seeps.  The impoundment has also contaminated local creeks and streams with toxic pollution.  Under the terms of the consent decree, FirstEnergy has agreed to close Little Blue Run by 2016. For more about information about Little Blue Run, see EIP’s report In Harm’s Way. Available here. In 2012, the EPA identified LBR as a location where coal ash disposal activities had been proven to contaminate ground and surface water.
