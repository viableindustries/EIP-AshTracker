Funded", "grant_description": "There are more than 300 publicly-funded passive treatment systems located throughout the coal fields of Pennsylvania. There are currently 171 systems that have water monitoring information available on Datashed (www.datashed.org). These 171 systems alone are treating 27.7 billion gallons of AMD every year and retaining 14 million lbs/year of iron (includes iron solids formed at both low-pH and circumneutral- pH) and 770,000 lbs/year of manganese. As many of these treatment systems have been on-line for a decade or longer, the available accumulated material is expected to be many times that retained on an annual basis. Eventually, the metal-bearing sludge will need to be removed in order for the treatment system to continue to function effectively. Historically, sludge from conventional (active) mine drainage treatment plants has been either placed in the backfill of surface mine operations, left in sludge drying ponds, pumped into underground mines, or in some cases disposed in landfill operations. Ideally, however, a much better end to this material would be to find a valuable use that would generate funding instead of watershed groups having to pay money \u201cto throw it away\u201d.     Clean Creek Products has developed methods to recover manganese and low-pH iron materials from passive treatment systems and has identified and evaluated numerous potential uses for the material. (Stream Restoration Inc. & BioMost, Inc., 6/2008, Manganese Resource Recovery Final Technical Report: DEP File No. OSM PA (AMD-04), 45pp with appendices.) One of the major challenges, however, of our non-profit effort is the lack of start-up funds, investors, etc. needed to focus personnel time and resources on marketing, research, product development, and sales. In 2012, Stream Restoration Incorporated was awarded a grant from the Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds (Foundation) to receive Capacity Building assistance from the Bayer Center for Nonprofit Management. The purpose of the grant is to assist with business planning aimed at developing markets for sale of the recovered material to achieve the goal of assisting watershed groups with Operation, Maintenance, and Rehabilitation (O&M) of their passive systems. CCP is seeking funding through the Foundation to complement the Capacity Building project. Funding will be used to work directly with industry to develop markets for relatively large quantities of recovered material. Initial investigations will likely include green building products such as bricks, pavers, and ceramic tiles as well as the use of these materials in water treatment operations and as soil amendments. The ultimate goal is to develop one or more markets that would purchase 100 to 200 tons per year each of recovered, processed as needed, manganese and low-pH iron oxides in order to generate thousands of dollars per year in funds that could be given back to watershed groups to assist with O&M activities.", "grant_type": "New Technologies", "grant_decision_date": "2013-04-01T10:26:11Z", "seller_address": ["434 Spring St. Ext., Mars, PA, 16046"], "grant_buyer": "Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds", "grant_application_date": "2013-03-15T10:26:04Z", "site_url": "http://fpw.rhizalabs.com/folio/detail/~0180137e602b6e11e3847e12f546864295", "grant_payment_amount": 15000, "project_date": "2013-10-02T14:30:24.8089199066162109Z", "grant_name": "Marketing Metal-Bearing Sludge to Support Volunteer Efforts", "project_cost_proposed": 25000, "grant_amount_requested": 15000, "grant_date": "2013-10-02T14:27:50.36730194091796875Z"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-78.04089903829998, 40.76368187610001]}, "_id": {"$oid": "527ea395ccdb5ea5e8bd20f0"}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"grant_sponsor_required": "False", "project_covered_by_conservation_plan": "False", "grant_status": "7a.

Illegal dumping poses direct hazards to both surface waters and groundwater. Where dumpsites are located close to waterways, direct run-off into streams can carry a number of hazardous pollutants, and leachate from dumpsites can ultimately affect surface waters and groundwater. In response to the problem of illegal dumping, a number of local grassroots organizations have formed throughout the Juniata basin under the auspices of Keep Pennsylvania Beautiful (formerly PA Cleanways). These local chapters have completed illegal dump surveys for every county in the watershed, cleaned up numerous illegal dumpsites and miles of littered roadsides, held recycling events for perishable goods such as tires and electronics, and conducted education and outreach events to make citizens aware of the illegal dumping problem. In 2013, affiliate chapters in Juniata and Perry counties (Keep Juniata County Beautiful and Keep Perry County Beautiful) expressed an interest in cleaning up sites along sections of the river in their respective counties. Representatives of all three chapters have started planning the event, tentatively planned for July 20th, 2013 (with a rain date of July 27th), and cleanup sites have been selected in all three counties.
