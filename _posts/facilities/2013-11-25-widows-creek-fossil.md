The Widows Creek Fossil Plant is located on the Tennessee River in Stevenson, AL. Widows Creek itself is a partially rechanneled stream that flows through the site. TVA built Units 1 through 6 in the 1950s. Two more units, Units 7 and 8, came online in 1964. As part of a recent compliance agreement with EPA, TVA has agreed to retire units 1-6 between 2013 and 2015, and all six units are currently idle.  In November 2013 TVA announced that it was retiring Unit 8.

Widows Creek has had a series of large and small structural issues over its lifetime, including erosion and sloughing along the southern perimeter of the bottom ash stack within Ash Pond A, seepage around Main Ash Pond A and the Old Scrubber Sludge Pond, and a large spill of gypsum from the active Gypsum Stack into the stilling pond and Widows Creek in January of 2009.
