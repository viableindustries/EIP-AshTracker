The Flint Creek facility houses a coal ash landfill and two ash ponds, the larger of which is approximately 42.8 acres and has a storage capacity of 484 acre-ft. According to permit files, seepage from the landfill was first documented in 2006. A leachate collection system was installed in 2010, and recent tests show that the leachate is high in selenium, boron and specific conductivity. Where the leachate is disposed is unclear. There is no groundwater monitoring of the ash pond area. According to Arkansas' Well Drilling Commission 45 private wells are located within a 2 mile radius of the Flint Creek site.
