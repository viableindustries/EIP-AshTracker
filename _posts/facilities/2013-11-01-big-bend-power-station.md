TECO operates a network of 11 coal ash impoundments and one landfill to accommodate ash and FGD waste produced by the Big Bend Station. Most of these impoundments are unlined. Florida DEP issued a consent order in 2001 citing contamination of ground and surface waters, including arsenic levels 11 times greater than the drinking water standard. Data collected almost ten years later (in October 2010) show that many monitoring wells still exceed health based standards for arsenic.
