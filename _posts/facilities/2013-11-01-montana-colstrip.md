PPL operates a network of nine coal ash impoundments at the Colstrip site. In 2003 a lawsuit was filed by residents of the town of Colstrip alleging groundwater pollution from the operations of Colstrip’s impoundments and waste ponds.  In May 2008 the five utility companies that jointly own and operate the Colstrip power plant finalized a $25 million settlement with the 57 plaintiffs who blame the utilities for contaminating their groundwater and causing structural damage to some properties. In August 2012, the operators of the facility entered into an “Administrative Order on Consent” with Montana DEQ to study the effectiveness of potential remediation strategies.  <a href="http://www.environmentalintegrity.org/news_reports/documents/outofcontrol-mountingdamagesfromcoalashwastesites.pdf" target="_blank">For more information about Colstrip, see EIP’s report Out of Control. Available here.</a> In 2012, the EPA identified Colstrip as a location where coal ash disposal activities have been proven to contaminate ground and surface water. <a href="http://www.environmentalintegrity.org/news_reports/documents/2013.08.12DamageCase_Portfolio_REVISED.pdf" target="_blank">For more information, check this report.</a>
