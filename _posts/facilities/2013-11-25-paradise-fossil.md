There are several ash disposal areas at Paradise, including a pair of bottom ash ponds in an abandoned strip mine pit adjacent to the Green River, Jacob’s Creek Ash Pond south of the plant, and an FGD disposal area southwest of the plant. The area around the Paradise plant has been severely disturbed by strip mining.  An aquifer 6 to 22 feet beneath the surface has been substantially removed by mining, and where it remains it is in direct contact with ash disposal areas. 

In November 2013, TVA announced that it would shut down two of three coal-powered units at the Paradise plant.
