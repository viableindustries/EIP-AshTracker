The 10-unit Johnsonville Fossil Plant, on the Tennessee River in New Johnsonville TN, is TVA’s oldest coal plant. Construction began in 1949 and the first unit went online in 1951. TVA idled four units in 2012. The plant will permanently close between 2015 and 2017.  	
	
TVA has four ash disposal areas at the Johnsonville Fossil Plant, including an unlined island in the Tennessee River, called “Active Ash Disposal Areas 2 & 3,” a closed dredged ash disposal area, a closed disposal area in the South Railroad Loop, and an abandoned unlined coal ash pond north of the Plant. 

The “Active Ash Disposal Area” is an 87-acre unlined CCW disposal situated on an island in the middle of the Tennessee River.  TVA began monitoring groundwater on the island for a short period in the early 1990s, and then resumed monitoring in 2011.  No wells on the island can be considered upgradient, and pollutants such as arsenic exceed federal standards at every single well on the island.

The Johnsonville Fossil Plant is located near several municipal water intake pipes along the Tennessee River, including the New Johnsonville Municipal Water Intake at River Mile 100.6, and the City of Camden Water Intake at River Mile 100.3.
