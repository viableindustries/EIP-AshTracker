The site is located on the shore of Lake Murray, near Columbia, South Carolina.  The current groundwater monitoring program was established in 2005 and has seven monitoring wells in the vicinity of the ash landfill south of the Saluda River and three monitoring wells north of the Saluda River.  
	
In May 2012, SCE & G announced that they planned to switch the two units at McMeekin from coal to natural gas by 2015 and to retire them completely by 2018.
