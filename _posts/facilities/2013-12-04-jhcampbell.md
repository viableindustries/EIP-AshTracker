The JH Campbell Generating Complex contains a 410 acre landfill, and is located about one mile east of Lake Michigan. In response to an EPA request for data in 2010, Consumers Energy admitted that discharges from the Complex contaminated groundwater in excess of state standards or federal standards for antimony, boron, chromium, lead, selenium, vanadium, cadmium, lead, manganese and zinc- though the facility does not routinely analyze groundwater samples for cadmium or lead.
