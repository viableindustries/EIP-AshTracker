The Shawnee Fossil Plant is located on the Ohio River in West Paducah, KY. TVA has been operating 10 coal units at the site since the mid-1950s. The Shawnee Fossil Plant has two contiguous CCW landfills designated as “special waste landfills” under the same permit, and two coal ash ponds.  Neither CCW landfill is lined nor are the coal ash ponds. The CCW landfill closest to the coal ash ponds has a partial final cover. The CCW landfills and coal ash ponds share a common groundwater monitoring system.  

Data obtained from Kentucky’s Well Log GIS layer show a total of 24 private wells within a two-mile radius of TVA’s Shawnee Fossil Plant.
