The AEP facility and CCW disposal sites sit on the edge of the bluffs overlooking the Ohio River. The disposal areas include the Bottom Ash Complex (Bottom Ash Pond and Recirculation Pond), Fly Ash Reservoir 1 (decomissioned) and Fly Ash Reservoir 2. In May of 2012, AEP applied for permission to raise the dam height of Reservoir 2 by 13 feet to accommodate waste disposal plans through 2019.

Hydrogeological reports document that the two reservoirs have “significantly impacted the site geomorphology and hydrogeologic conditions” due to the filling of two branches of Block House Hollow and valley fills of saturated fly ash; the reservoirs likely contribute recharge (and contamination) to upper aquifers, which are themselves hydrologically connected to lower aquifers shared by nearby residential wells.
