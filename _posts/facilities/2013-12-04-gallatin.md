Gallatin is located on the north bank of the Cumberland River, about 30 miles northeast of Nashville, TN. It consumes approximately 12,350 tons of coal per day. The original ash pond was located immediately west of the power plant; TVA abandoned this pond in 1970 when it built the existing ash pond complex to the north of the plant. Within the active ash pond complex, the active fly ash pond receives 185,000 dry tons of fly ash each year, and the bottom ash pond receives roughly 45,000 dry tons of bottom ash.
	
Many public drinking water sources for communities near the TVA Gallatin Plant use treated water directly from the Cumberland River. For example, the Gallatin Water Department, which serves approximately 38,000 people and supplies water to other companies, such as Castalian Springs in Bethpage, TN, is located just over one mile downstream of the TVA Gallatin Steam Plant’s Ash Ponds.
