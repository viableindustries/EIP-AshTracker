John Sevier Fossil Plant includes four coal units on the Holston River near Rogersville, TN. The plant went online in 1955, and TVA retired two and idled the others in 2012. TVA originally disposed of the ash from John Sevier in a series of ponds located along the Holston River, in the area now covered by the dry fly ash disposal area and the sediment pond. In 1979, TVA started using Area 2 as a bottom ash pond and started disposing of dry fly ash on top of the fly ash and bottom ash in the old ash ponds. Ash Disposal Area J had a shorter lifespan - TVA started using Area J as a fly ash settling pond in 1982, converted to dry stacking in 1988, and closed the area in 1999.
