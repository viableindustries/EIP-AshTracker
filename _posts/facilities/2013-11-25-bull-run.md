The Bull Run Fossil Plant has one large coal-fired unit. It is located on the east shore of the Clinch River, directly upstream from where Bull Run Creek meets the river. The US EPA identified the Bull Run Fossil Plant in Tennessee as a potential damage case in 2007, based on exceedances of Secondary MCLs and some evidence of ecological impacts.  According to its <a href="http://www.tva.com/power/construction/BRF_boundary_expansion.html" target="_blank">website</a>, TVA is seeking to expand its property by about 175 acres to accommodate an increased volume of CCR materials that will be produced in the coming years.  The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review began in January 2013 and a public meeting is planned for the spring of 2015.
