The Kingston fossil plant is located outside of Kingston, TN, at the confluence of the Clinch and Emory Rivers. The nine coal units at Kingston were built in the 1950s; at the time it was the largest coal plant in the world. Kingston is notorious as the site of the largest coal ash spill in U.S. history. On December 22, 2008, the ash dredge cell at the Kingston plant collapsed, spilling 5.4 million cubic yards of ash into local waterways and over 300 acres of land. 
	
Prior to the ash spill, TVA was disposing of ash in a complex that included a dredge cell, a settling pond, and a stilling pond. TVA has used this area for ash disposal since 1958. Since the spill, TVA has switched to dry ash disposal at Kingston, but continues to use the reconstructed ash complex area, including the original stilling pond. TVA recently built a sulfur dioxide scrubber sludge (gypsum) disposal area south of the plant.  That area experienced a significant sinkhole collapse shortly after it was put into service, draining selenium and other pollutants into the Clinch River.
