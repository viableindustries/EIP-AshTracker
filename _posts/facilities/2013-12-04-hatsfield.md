The Hatfields Ferry Power plant disposes of its ash waste in an unlined 40 acre landfill near the Little Whitely Creek in southwest Pennsylvania. The landfill has been contaminating one of the creeks tributaries for almost ten years, threatening the safety of private drinking water wells in the area. In 2008, the Pennsylvania DEP issued a Consent Order and Agreement requiring Allegheny Energy to implement a corrective action plan and pay civil penalties of more than $20,000. In July 2013 FirstEnergy announced that it would be deactivating the power plant by the end of 2013. The company said, however, that the landfill may stay open and accept waste from other facilities. For more about information about Hatfield, see EIPs report In Harms Way. Available here. In 2012, the EPA identified Hatfields Ferry as a location where coal ash disposal activities have been proven to contaminate ground and surface water. For more information, check this report.
