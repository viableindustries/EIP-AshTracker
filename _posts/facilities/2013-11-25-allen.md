The Allen Steam Plant has five coal-fired generating units; the newest of which began operating in 1961. It is located on the banks of the Catawba River. In its 2007 Damage Case Assessment, EPA found that there were documented exceedances of non-health based standards for manganese and iron in wells downstream from the facility based on historic data.  In the August 2013, the State of North Carolina entered into a consent decree regarding seeps and other unpermitted discharges to groundwater. Concerned that the State would not require Duke to implement any meaningful remedies, the Catawba Riverkeeper sought (and was granted) the opportunity to intervene in the ongoing case.
