These systems promote increased forage production, require less energy input, result in a better distribution of manure nutrients, improve water quality, reduce stormwater runoff volumes, and lower production costs. Seven presenters are scheduled for the first day, including Keynote Speaker, Temple Grandin. The second day of the conference will feature animal handling demonstrations and several tours, including: farms that use grazing systems; Windgate Vineyard and Winery; a dairy farm with a manure digester/electric generation system, a soybean processing facility making feed and oil for biodiesel production, and grazing systems that use solar water pumps; and the Seward GenOn facility that uses coal waste piles located throughout the Ohio River basin.", "grant_type": "Settlement", "grant_decision_date": "2012-04-01T08:29:52Z", "seller_address": ["1432 Route 286 Highway East, Indiana, PA, 15701"], "grant_buyer": "Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds", "grant_application_date": "2011-12-28T08:29:31Z", "site_url": "http://fpw.rhizalabs.com/folio/detail/~019a3e5f207d8811e1917453e2169151db", "grant_payment_amount": 2000, "project_date": "2012-04-03T12:32:16.2647089958190918Z", "grant_name": "Southwest Project Grass Grazing Conference 2012", "project_cost_proposed": 15000, "grant_amount_requested": 2000, "grant_date": "2012-08-28T12:40:54.2870969772338867Z"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[-80.010176897, 41.011576189], [-80.010176897, 41.011576189]]}, "_id": {"$oid": "527ea392ccdb5ea5e8bd2063"}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"grant_sponsor_required": "False", "project_covered_by_conservation_plan": "False", "grant_status": "7a.
