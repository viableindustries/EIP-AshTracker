Funded", "grant_description": "The Ninevah Borehole sits on the edge of the town of Seward where it drains a 500 acre deep mine that has been flowing at a high rate since active mining ended at the site in the 1920s.  The mine void is filled with water which produces abandoned mine drainage at the rate of  500gpm , only 300 yards from the banks of the Conemaugh River. Site conditions preclude the use of a passive treatment system (lack of open space).  The chosen technology is alkaline injection into the mine and a polishing wetland for the water coming out of the borehole. The vision for this opportunity has come from the fact that Reliant Energy is building a fluidized bed coal burning plant in this town and needs to dispose of the fly ash from the plant.  The water now is a pH of 2 and this type of fly ash has a pH of 14.  It is thought that with injection, the fly ash will set up like cement,  producing upon contact with the water, H20 with a pH such that the passive treatment system can separate metals and polish the water before it enters the stream.  This is a large scale, high cost project, endorsed by BAMR, the Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation.  Their district office is nearby and they are very interested in the outcome of the first engineering studies underway.

We do this by providing leadership, coordination and assistance to organizations focused on the conservation and protection of PA\u2019s coldwater streams and our wild trout populations. \nThe CHP program is a cooperative initiative of the PA DCNR, PA Fish and Boat Commission, PA Trout (A Council of Trout Unlimited) and the Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds. \nGoals of the Coldwater Heritage Partnership Program:\n1. Foster a greater public understanding of watershed characteristics as they affect coldwater ecosystems.\n2. Build partnerships that improve the ability to protect our headwater resources.\n3.

Funded", "grant_description": "The local chapter of the organization, the Three Rivers Habitat Partnership, was awarded this grant to implement a native species garden.  The garden comprises 55 acres and nearly 1mile of riparian plantings along Deer Creek.  The garden illustrates the diversity of native species and showcases how native species thrive in their native habitat. Native species are also effective in thwarting the growth of invasive species.  This garden provides appeal to urban residents who have small land plots and that seek the refuge of nature. This grant is for the calendar year of 2004 and is a partnership among the organization, Trout Unlimited, and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The goal is to provide planning and protection grants to groups monitoring stream stretches where there are native, reproducing trout. Another goal is to secure DEP stream designations of High Quality or Exceptional Value, which provides legal clout for stopping development close to a stream.", "grant_type": "Riparian Buffer Zones", "grant_decision_date": "2003-10-01", "seller_address": ["8737 Colesville Rd., Silver Spring, MD, 20910"], "grant_buyer": "Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds", "grant_application_date": "2003-08-28T15:19:16Z", "site_url": "http://fpw.rhizalabs.com/folio/detail/~011130458c6b4711de8e74717e31e9017a", "grant_payment_amount": 21000, "project_date": "2010-08-02T19:04:25.42719292640686035Z", "project_name": "3 Rivers Habitat Parnership Backyard Buffers", "project_endtime_min": "2004-12-31T15:22:23Z", "project_starttime_min": "2004-01-01T15:22:14Z", "grant_name": "3 Rivers Habitat Partnership Backyard Buffers", "project_cost_proposed": 59879, "grant_grant_id": 288, "grant_amount_requested": 21000, "grant_date": "2010-08-06T17:51:12.40224504470825195Z"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-79.4996666908, 40.309001692]}, "_id": {"$oid": "527ea384ccdb5ea5e8bd1dc7"}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"grant_sponsor_required": "False", "project_covered_by_conservation_plan": "False", "grant_status": "7a.
