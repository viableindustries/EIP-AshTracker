Funded", "grant_description": "The Ninevah Borehole sits on the edge of the town of Seward where it drains a 500 acre deep mine that has been flowing at a high rate since active mining ended at the site in the 1920s.  The mine void is filled with water which produces abandoned mine drainage at the rate of  500gpm , only 300 yards from the banks of the Conemaugh River. Site conditions preclude the use of a passive treatment system (lack of open space).  The chosen technology is alkaline injection into the mine and a polishing wetland for the water coming out of the borehole. The vision for this opportunity has come from the fact that Reliant Energy is building a fluidized bed coal burning plant in this town and needs to dispose of the fly ash from the plant.  The water now is a pH of 2 and this type of fly ash has a pH of 14.  It is thought that with injection, the fly ash will set up like cement,  producing upon contact with the water, H20 with a pH such that the passive treatment system can separate metals and polish the water before it enters the stream.

The garden illustrates the diversity of native species and showcases how native species thrive in their native habitat. Native species are also effective in thwarting the growth of invasive species.  This garden provides appeal to urban residents who have small land plots and that seek the refuge of nature. This grant is for the calendar year of 2004 and is a partnership among the organization, Trout Unlimited, and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The goal is to provide planning and protection grants to groups monitoring stream stretches where there are native, reproducing trout. Another goal is to secure DEP stream designations of High Quality or Exceptional Value, which provides legal clout for stopping development close to a stream.", "grant_type": "Riparian Buffer Zones", "grant_decision_date": "2003-10-01", "seller_address": ["8737 Colesville Rd., Silver Spring, MD, 20910"], "grant_buyer": "Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds", "grant_application_date": "2003-08-28T15:19:16Z", "site_url": "http://fpw.rhizalabs.com/folio/detail/~011130458c6b4711de8e74717e31e9017a", "grant_payment_amount": 21000, "project_date": "2010-08-02T19:04:25.42719292640686035Z", "project_name": "3 Rivers Habitat Parnership Backyard Buffers", "project_endtime_min": "2004-12-31T15:22:23Z", "project_starttime_min": "2004-01-01T15:22:14Z", "grant_name": "3 Rivers Habitat Partnership Backyard Buffers", "project_cost_proposed": 59879, "grant_grant_id": 288, "grant_amount_requested": 21000, "grant_date": "2010-08-06T17:51:12.40224504470825195Z"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-79.4996666908, 40.309001692]}, "_id": {"$oid": "527ea384ccdb5ea5e8bd1dc7"}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"grant_sponsor_required": "False", "project_covered_by_conservation_plan": "False", "grant_status": "7a.

This active treatment system, developed by Dietz et al, has been operating at the plant for over two years. Designs are underway to enlarge the Reactor to accommodate the treatment of the Upper Saxman Run Discharge and two other discharges.

The first project is a mine pool stabilization which protects the lower Kettle Creek and the West Branch Susquehanna River from the impending catastrophic mine blowout of the Kettle Creek No. 1 mine on the west side of lower Kettle Creek. This project has reduced the environmental hazard posed by the collapsed KC204A mine drain in three ways. First, by reestablishing two drains the mine can now drain freely from three locations. Prior to the project, the collapse of the single free flowing drain (KC204) would have led to a dangerous buildup of water within the mine. Second, the reestablished mine drains reduce the likelihood of a mine pool blowout by allowing the mine to discharge greater flows at lower mine pool elevations. In  this way, the probability of excessive mine pool elevations is reduced. Third, since the mine pool is kept at a lower elevation, the total volume of water that could be released if a blowout would occur has been reduced. As a result, the potential damage caused by a blowout is reduced.\nThe second project will be to design, permit, and construct the Swamp Area Passive Treatment System. This project will address the first major source of AMD to Twomile Run, which is Class A native brook trout stream above the AMD pollution.", "project_miles_improved": 20, "grant_decision_date": "2007-10-01T08:52:01Z", "grant_buyer": "Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds", "grant_application_date": "2007-06-04T08:51:48Z", "site_url": "http://fpw.rhizalabs.com/folio/detail/~013f441c38d52211de96636047474a252f", "grant_payment_amount": 20000, "grant_type": "Abandoned Mine Drainage", "project_date": "2011-09-27T19:11:59.6498379707336426Z", "grant_name": "Kettle Creek AMD", "project_cost_proposed": 205980, "grant_amount_requested": 20000, "grant_date": "2012-02-22T19:12:49.6298971176147461Z"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-79.96448278429999, 40.4507190541]}, "_id": {"$oid": "527ea38accdb5ea5e8bd1ed2"}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"grant_sponsor_required": "False", "project_covered_by_conservation_plan": "False", "grant_status": "7a.

With the 30th Anniversary of the federal law having passed last year, and with numerous judicial and regulatory decisions that have affected the law and citizen\u2019s right, an update to the book is long overdue. The Natural Resources Law Center at the University of Colorado Law School is committed to preparing this update and has begun the redrafting of several chapters and is hoping to attract modest support for this effort. It is a vital educational tool that outlines particular provisions of the newly reauthorized Abandoned Mine Land Fund and its SMCRA provisions.", "grant_type": "Abandoned Mine Drainage", "grant_decision_date": "2008-10-01T09:42:04Z", "seller_address": ["914 Broadway 17 UCB, Boulder, CO, 80309"], "grant_buyer": "Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds", "site_url": "http://fpw.rhizalabs.com/folio/detail/~0116f775b6ea6411de896e482a13391837", "grant_payment_amount": 9500, "project_date": "2013-01-25T14:13:39.3801538944244385Z", "grant_name": "\"Strip Mining Handbook\"", "project_cost_proposed": 9500, "grant_amount_requested": 14000, "grant_date": "2010-09-09T18:56:42.9341950416564941Z"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[-78.26278209684543, 41.35548684536362], [-78.26484203336896, 41.35674315247924], [-78.26909065244853, 41.35783837479559], [-78.26986312864477, 41.3591912710365], [-78.27067852018526, 41.3595455963571], [-78.2719230651682, 41.359384539632316], [-78.2737684249705, 41.35967444144998], [-78.28432559965304, 41.35674315247924], [-78.28969001768291, 41.35919127103649], [-78.28990459440404, 41.360028764140075], [-78.29127788541965, 41.3601898192706], [-78.2969856262034, 41.36215465977065], [-78.29814434049777, 41.361768138457776], [-78.29865932462873, 41.362122449748945], [-78.30299377439673, 41.36228349969811], [-78.3041524886912, 41.360995088944804], [-78.30505371092016, 41.36125277313613], [-78.31501007078349, 41.36105951008828], [-78.31608295438943, 41.360511928335995], [-78.3172845840281, 41.36125277313613], [-78.3198595046824, 41.36073740373315], [-78.32015991209207, 41.35970665268333], [-78.32217693327127, 41.360028764140075], [-78.32363605497537, 41.35961001893541], [-78.32543849943337, 41.36028645215762], [-78.326811790449, 41.360286452157624], [-78.32809925077615, 41.359320116830816], [-78.32985877988993, 41.35938453963232], [-78.33080291746319, 41.36012539726624], [-78.3346652984446, 41.36080182513174], [-78.33775520322978, 41.36283106654405], [-78.33951473234353, 41.36257338860226], [-78.34226131437482, 41.36312095300892], [-78.34311962125959, 41.362122449748945], [-78.34569454191383, 41.362122449748945], [-78.34650993345436, 41.36138161484917], [-78.34771156309306, 41.36144603561004], [-78.3490419387644, 41.360705193009956], [-78.35474967954818, 41.36463478356712], [-78.35530757902322, 41.36447373943706], [-78.35668087003886, 41.36521453913519], [-78.358139991743, 41.365053496439984], [-78.35852622984112, 41.36531116456101], [-78.36011409757788, 41.365536623329895], [-78.3614444732493, 41.364280485954865], [-78.36217403410132, 41.36482803599708], [-78.36792469022933, 41.36244454924874], [-78.37346076963607, 41.3662129949493], [-78.37483406065162, 41.36878958432782], [-78.37831020353492, 41.371044016332476], [-78.37989807127182, 41.37101181071102], [-78.38135719297587, 41.37207458780086], [-78.38238716123762, 41.375230611363], [-78.38599205015363, 41.377839045867], [-78.3923864364451, 41.37896611483005]]}, "_id": {"$oid": "527ea38cccdb5ea5e8bd1f2d"}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"grant_sponsor_required": "False", "project_covered_by_conservation_plan": "False", "grant_status": "7a.

However, a grant award is not a certainty, plus the process requires lengthy time spans and is usually inadequate for emergency situations. WPCAMR, DEP, and others recognized that there had to be a better way to provide funding for, at the very least, emergency repairs. WPCAMR successfully applied to Growing Greener in 2006 to create a \u201cQuick Response\u201d program. The program is a cooperative effort between DEP and WPCAMR.

The second day of the conference will feature animal handling demonstrations and several tours, including: farms that use grazing systems; Windgate Vineyard and Winery; a dairy farm with a manure digester/electric generation system, a soybean processing facility making feed and oil for biodiesel production, and grazing systems that use solar water pumps; and the Seward GenOn facility that uses coal waste piles located throughout the Ohio River basin.", "grant_type": "Settlement", "grant_decision_date": "2012-04-01T08:29:52Z", "seller_address": ["1432 Route 286 Highway East, Indiana, PA, 15701"], "grant_buyer": "Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds", "grant_application_date": "2011-12-28T08:29:31Z", "site_url": "http://fpw.rhizalabs.com/folio/detail/~019a3e5f207d8811e1917453e2169151db", "grant_payment_amount": 2000, "project_date": "2012-04-03T12:32:16.2647089958190918Z", "grant_name": "Southwest Project Grass Grazing Conference 2012", "project_cost_proposed": 15000, "grant_amount_requested": 2000, "grant_date": "2012-08-28T12:40:54.2870969772338867Z"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[-80.010176897, 41.011576189], [-80.010176897, 41.011576189]]}, "_id": {"$oid": "527ea392ccdb5ea5e8bd2063"}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"grant_sponsor_required": "False", "project_covered_by_conservation_plan": "False", "grant_status": "7a.

There are currently 171 systems that have water monitoring information available on Datashed (www.datashed.org). These 171 systems alone are treating 27.7 billion gallons of AMD every year and retaining 14 million lbs/year of iron (includes iron solids formed at both low-pH and circumneutral- pH) and 770,000 lbs/year of manganese. As many of these treatment systems have been on-line for a decade or longer, the available accumulated material is expected to be many times that retained on an annual basis. Eventually, the metal-bearing sludge will need to be removed in order for the treatment system to continue to function effectively. Historically, sludge from conventional (active) mine drainage treatment plants has been either placed in the backfill of surface mine operations, left in sludge drying ponds, pumped into underground mines, or in some cases disposed in landfill operations. Ideally, however, a much better end to this material would be to find a valuable use that would generate funding instead of watershed groups having to pay money \u201cto throw it away\u201d.     Clean Creek Products has developed methods to recover manganese and low-pH iron materials from passive treatment systems and has identified and evaluated numerous potential uses for the material. (Stream Restoration Inc. & BioMost, Inc., 6/2008, Manganese Resource Recovery Final Technical Report: DEP File No. OSM PA (AMD-04), 45pp with appendices.) One of the major challenges, however, of our non-profit effort is the lack of start-up funds, investors, etc. needed to focus personnel time and resources on marketing, research, product development, and sales. In 2012, Stream Restoration Incorporated was awarded a grant from the Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds (Foundation) to receive Capacity Building assistance from the Bayer Center for Nonprofit Management. The purpose of the grant is to assist with business planning aimed at developing markets for sale of the recovered material to achieve the goal of assisting watershed groups with Operation, Maintenance, and Rehabilitation (O&M) of their passive systems. CCP is seeking funding through the Foundation to complement the Capacity Building project. Funding will be used to work directly with industry to develop markets for relatively large quantities of recovered material. Initial investigations will likely include green building products such as bricks, pavers, and ceramic tiles as well as the use of these materials in water treatment operations and as soil amendments. The ultimate goal is to develop one or more markets that would purchase 100 to 200 tons per year each of recovered, processed as needed, manganese and low-pH iron oxides in order to generate thousands of dollars per year in funds that could be given back to watershed groups to assist with O&M activities.", "grant_type": "New Technologies", "grant_decision_date": "2013-04-01T10:26:11Z", "seller_address": ["434 Spring St. Ext., Mars, PA, 16046"], "grant_buyer": "Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds", "grant_application_date": "2013-03-15T10:26:04Z", "site_url": "http://fpw.rhizalabs.com/folio/detail/~0180137e602b6e11e3847e12f546864295", "grant_payment_amount": 15000, "project_date": "2013-10-02T14:30:24.8089199066162109Z", "grant_name": "Marketing Metal-Bearing Sludge to Support Volunteer Efforts", "project_cost_proposed": 25000, "grant_amount_requested": 15000, "grant_date": "2013-10-02T14:27:50.36730194091796875Z"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-78.04089903829998, 40.76368187610001]}, "_id": {"$oid": "527ea395ccdb5ea5e8bd20f0"}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"grant_sponsor_required": "False", "project_covered_by_conservation_plan": "False", "grant_status": "7a.

In response to the problem of illegal dumping, a number of local grassroots organizations have formed throughout the Juniata basin under the auspices of Keep Pennsylvania Beautiful (formerly PA Cleanways). These local chapters have completed illegal dump surveys for every county in the watershed, cleaned up numerous illegal dumpsites and miles of littered roadsides, held recycling events for perishable goods such as tires and electronics, and conducted education and outreach events to make citizens aware of the illegal dumping problem. In 2013, affiliate chapters in Juniata and Perry counties (Keep Juniata County Beautiful and Keep Perry County Beautiful) expressed an interest in cleaning up sites along sections of the river in their respective counties.

Of the unassessed waters remaining, many of these likely support wild trout populations. The primary threat to these unassessed wild trout waters are inadequate water quality protection. The lack of water quality protection is primarily due to not having adequate knowledge of trout populations in these streams. The importance of adequately protecting streams has increased dramatically with the recent expansion of Marcellus Shale gas extraction throughout much of the state. Susquehanna University and Dr. Jonathan Niles have been asked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to again be part of a collaborative effort to assess how natural gas development of the Marcellus shale geological formation may affect trout streams in the Pennsylvania highlands.
