These studies have indicated that Pennsylvania has significant potential to increase the use of this clean, renewable energy, reduce air pollution, and grow its economy by taking greater advantage of hydropower in its 83,000 miles of streams and rivers, as well as in water treatment plants and industrial processes using flowing water. The Pennsylvania Environmental Council (PEC) hosted a meeting of 43 participants representing businesses, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations involved in the hydropower industry, particularly small and micro hydro. The purpose of this summit was to determine, from the perspective of organizations actually working on hydropower projects, the impediments to greater use of hydropower and to create a list of next steps for facilitating greater use of this resource in a way that is good for the environment, the economy, and the communities of the state.", "grant_type": "Convening Grants", "grant_decision_date": "2012-10-01T08:13:22Z", "seller_address": ["130 Locust St., Harrisburg, PA, 18709"], "grant_buyer": "Foundation for Pennsylvania Watersheds", "grant_application_date": "2012-10-16T08:13Z", "site_url": "http://fpw.rhizalabs.com/folio/detail/~011134e9e460a711e2b89032cb2c7f2203", "grant_payment_amount": 2000, "project_date": "2013-01-17T13:16:01.5125579833984375Z", "grant_name": "PA Hydropower Summit", "project_cost_proposed": 3500, "grant_amount_requested": 2000, "grant_date": "2013-08-06T10:52:38.44698309898376465Z"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "LineString", "coordinates": [[-76.8861329556, 40.26475008869999], [-76.8861329556, 40.26475008869999]]}, "_id": {"$oid": "527ea394ccdb5ea5e8bd20ab"}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"grant_sponsor_required": "False", "project_covered_by_conservation_plan": "False", "grant_status": "7a.
