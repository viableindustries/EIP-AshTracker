<p>Coyote Station maintains one active landfill and two ponds. There are also two closed landfills at the site. The North Dakota Department of Health (NDDH) ordered one of the ponds to be lined in the early 1980’s to control seepage.  The NDDH has expressed concern that “baseline” values for pollutant levels were affected by historic seepage and therefore current monitoring cannot adequately detect contamination. In response to an EPA request for data in 2010, Otter Tail admitted that discharges from its facility contaminated groundwater in excess of federal standards for arsenic, manganese and sulfate.</p>
